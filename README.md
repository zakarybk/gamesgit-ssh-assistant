# SSH add assistant (Windows)
A script to create an SSH key and save it to ssh/config and upload the key to bitbucket with minimal effort

This has been tested on Windows 10 ONLY.
It's likely to work on 7/8 as well.

Simply run setup-gamesgit.bat by double clicking on it once you have downloaded it!
You will need to extract the zip file first if downloading directly off of GitHub - [download link](https://github.com/zakarybk/gamesgit-ssh-assistant/archive/windows-batch.zip)

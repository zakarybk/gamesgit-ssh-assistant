# SSH add assistant (Windows)
A script to create an SSH key and save it to ssh/config and upload the key to bitbucket with minimal effort

This has been tested on Windows 10 ONLY.
It's likely to work on 7/8 as well.

Simply run setup-gamesgit.bat by double clicking on it once you have downloaded it!
You will need to extract the zip file first if downloading directly off of GitHub - [download link](https://github.com/zakarybk/gamesgit-ssh-assistant/archive/windows-batch.zip)

You may want to open a separate command line console (cmd in windows search) to run this if the output is being closed before you can read it. Simply make sure you have the file extracted and navigate to it using Windows exploerer (file browser) and goto the top of Windows explorer and copy the path to your clipboard. Then in cmd type cd followed by (control + v/paste) and enter to get to the directroy where the file is extracted. Finally type setup-gamesgit.bat into cmd.

Example:
* Windows search -> cmd -> open
* cmd -> cd C:/Users/Me/Downloads/windows-batch
* cmd -> setup-gamesgit.bat
